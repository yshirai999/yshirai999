## ðŸ”¬ What I'm working on

One of my current focuses is the development of a robust, end-to-end pipeline for a **systematic equity strategy**.  
This work integrates tools from **copula modeling**, **Bilateral Gamma distributions**, and **distributionally sensitive optimization**.

Repo: [**Systematic Equity Strategies**](https://github.com/yshirai999/Systematic-Equity-Strategies)  
Non-technical article: [A Robust Systematic Equity Strategy]([https://medium.com/@yshirai999/a-robust-systematic-equity-strategy-82a2c88144f4](https://medium.com/@yoshihiroshirai/a-robust-systematic-equity-strategies-d26ea229bde0))

This strategy blends:
- Economic intuition
- Statistical rigor
- Tail-risk control under real-world market dynamics
